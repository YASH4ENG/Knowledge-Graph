performance of an embedding model.\n","    The evaluation protocol follows the procedure defined in :cite:`bordes2013translating` and can be summarised as:\n","    #. Artificially generate negative triples by corrupting first the subject and then the object.\n","    #. Remove the positive triples from the set returned by (1) -- positive triples \\\n","    are usually the concatenation of training, validation and test sets.\n","    #. Rank each test triple against all remaining triples returned by (2).\n","    With the ranks of both object and subject corruptions, one may compute metrics such as the MRR by\n","    calculating them separately and then averaging them out.\n","    Note that the metrics implemented in AmpliGraph's ``evaluate.metrics`` module will already work that way\n","    when provided with the input returned by ``evaluate_performance``.\n","    The artificially generated negatives are compliant with the local closed world assumption (LCWA),\n","    as described in :cite:`nickel2016review`. In practice, that means only one side of the triple is corrupted at a time\n","    (i.e. either the subject or the object).\n","    .. note::\n","        The evaluation protocol assigns the worst rank\n","        to a positive test triple in case of a tie with negatives. This is the agreed upon behaviour in literature.\n","    .. hint::\n","        When ``entities_subset=None``, the method will use all distinct entities in the knowledge graph ``X``\n","        to generate negatives to rank against. This might slow down the eval. Some of the corruptions may not even\n","        make sense for the task that one may be interested in.\n","        For eg, consider the case <Actor, acted_in, ?>, where we are mainly interested in such movies that an actor\n","        has acted in. A sensible way to evaluate this would be to rank against all the movie entities and compute\n","        the desired metrics. In such cases, where focus us on particular task, it is recommended to pass the desired\n","        entities to use to generate corruptions to ``entities_subset``. Besides, trying to rank a positive against an\n","        extremely large number of negatives may be overkilling.\n","        As a reference, the popular FB15k-237 dataset has ~15k distinct entities.
